# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
a versatile game developer with a strong mathematics background, blending coding expertise and creative design skills. I have experience in developing core systems and architecting intuitive code, as well as creating editor tools, producing visual effects, and rigging and animating characters.

Known for my problem-solving abilities and creative experimentation, I thrive in cross-disciplinary collaboration. With a diverse skill set spanning technical and artistic domains, I consider myself a jack of all trades in game development.
