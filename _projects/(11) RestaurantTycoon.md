# Restaurant Empire Tycoon Idle

In my role as the lead developer for Restaurant Empire Tycoon, I spearheaded the development of critical background systems and various plugins, including:

Creation of a node-based visual scripting editor
Implementation of a node-based tutorial editor, seamlessly integrated with the visual scripting system
Establishment of a world logic separation feature, enabling independent loading and unloading of worlds
Implementation of encryption protocols for version and currency data, ensuring security at both runtime and data level
Integration of Firebase for authentication, cloud data saving, and custom game versioning, facilitating seamless distribution of multiple game versions to players
Implementation of AB testing capabilities, allowing dynamic modification of game data without necessitating updates or hard-coded values
This is just a snapshot of the extensive work undertaken, with many more contributions to the project.
