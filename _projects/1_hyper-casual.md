# Hoop Jump

The goal for this project was to prototype a hyper-casual game where we control a ball that traverses the path automatically
but we can jump the ball at anytime using an aimer. The game was made entirely by me, including all models and animations.

The level design tool for this game was a modular system where prefabs could be welded together to form a level and any prefab could be selected to form a sequential list.

**Highlighted skills:**

* **Understanding of game-feel:** I've paid close attention to the timing and speed of all animations/movements to create the best game-feel possible
* **Shaders:** Custom shaders on the ball, hoops and targets for improved visuals and game-feel
* **Game Logic:** Fully functional, looping game logic.

This project was developed during my time at Hero Games.
Due to being a prototype, there might be some bugs or unfixed issues in the video.

# Tile Escape!

I developed the entire game except the 3D models and the selection of colors. See the gameplay video below:

My work for this game consist of:
- A grid system
- An action system that resembles a turn based system, where the enemy side is AI
- A visual level editor that allows the game designers to design levels easily, exports level data as text files for them to be loaded in runtime.
See the showcase video below.


**Highlighted skills:**

* **Systematic Approach to Development:** I implemented different systems that tackle the different parts of the game logic.
  * A grid system
  * An action system that resembles a turn based system, where the enemy side is AI
* **Editor Tool Development:** A visual level editor that allows the game designers to design levels easily, exports level data as text files for them to be loaded in runtime.
* **Game Logic:** Fully functional, looping game logic.

See the level editor in action below:

# Jump & Dash

The goal for this prototype was to create a runner with the feeling of Hollow Knight's dash mechanic where we overcome obstacles / collect collectables by mainly jumping and dashing.

I coded the entire prototype, including SDK integrations such as Facebook SDK and Google Analytics. The running / dashing physics were implemented by me as I opted not to use Unity's own physics engine for this project. 
I designed tools for the designers that allowed them to design the levels themselves by using:

- A path editor
- Volumes that modify the characters behaviour such as extra long dashes

See the showcase video below.

**Highlighted skills:**

- **Custom Physics:** The physics for the character was handled manually
- **Editor Tool Development:** A custom path editor which allowed game designers to define the path that would be followed by the character. Special bounding boxes that modify the characters physics.
- **Game Logic:** Fully functional, looping game logic.

Due to being a prototype, there might be some bugs or unfixed issues in the video.

# Squishy Ball

I developed the entire game including all visuals.
The levels are generated, thus there is no level editor.
However I did expose variables that allowed the game designers to change 
hoop heights and pole distances as they see fit, including the length of levels.
