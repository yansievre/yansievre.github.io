## Working at Kolibri Games

At Kolibri Games, my role as a Unity Developer for Idle Miner Tycoon 
has seen me engaged in a broad spectrum of features and tasks. 
My contributions have been diverse and include, but are not limited to, 
the following areas:

- Bug fixing, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted game experience for players.
- Tech health improvements, focusing on the optimization and efficiency of 
game performance.
- Creation and implementation of Visual Effects (VFX), 
enhancing the game's visual appeal.
- Development of UI functionality, improving user interaction and accessibility.
- Implementation of characters and their special abilities, 
adding depth and strategy to the gameplay.
- Enhancement of game systems for better reusability and abstraction, 
facilitating easier updates and maintenance.
- Documentation of systems, providing clear guidelines and references 
for the development team.

Among my most significant contributions is the development of Super Managers, 
where I played a crucial role in bringing these central characters to life. 
Additionally, my initiative to develop a unified item view across the game 
stands out as a testament to my commitment to improving game design and 
functionality. This effort not only streamlined the in-game item management 
but also significantly enhanced the user experience by providing a cohesive 
and intuitive interface.

### Super Managers


As a Unity Developer for Idle Miner Tycoon at Kolibri Games, 
I played a key role in developing 18 Super Managers, the game's primary 
characters. My responsibilities included Unity-side development, 
particularly focusing on visual effects, and collaborating with 
the Art Department to ensure a unified character vision. 
This encompassed not only the implementation of character abilities and 
visual effects but also contributing creative ideas for character designs 
and abilities. My work ensured that each Super Manager offered a unique 
strategic advantage to players, enhancing the gaming experience through 
a combination of visual appeal and functional innovation.

Below you can see some of the super managers I've worked on:

### Unified Item View

After encountering challenges with how items were managed in the codebase, 
I initiated a comprehensive overhaul of the item system in IMT. This effort 
extended beyond mere programming tasks, encompassing collaboration with 
UI/UX to design a versatile item view applicable across various game 
contexts. In spearheading this project, I assumed a producer-like 
responsibility, overseeing the initiative from conception to implementation.

The project unfolded in several key stages:
- Conducting a thorough analysis of the existing codebase to identify and 
document inefficient practices.
- Researching item management strategies in successful games to understand 
industry standards and best practices.
- Developing a new workflow for Game Designers and Artists to accomodate the changes.
- Coding new systems that were not only intuitive for other developers but 
also significantly enhanced code clarity and maintainability.
- Overhauling the data structure to improve readability and compatibility 
with version control systems, reducing the risk of errors.
- Introducing modern designs to update the game’s feel and align with 
current standards.
- Choosing the Daily Reward panel for the initial implementation of these 
improvements due to its outdated design and isolated functionality, 
- ensuring minimal risk to other game components. 

This initiative demonstrated my ability to identify areas for improvement, 
devise strategic solutions, and lead cross-functional teams towards a common 
goal, ultimately elevating the game’s quality and user experience.
