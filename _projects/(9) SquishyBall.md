# Squishy Ball

I developed the entire game including all visuals.
The levels are generated, thus there is no level editor.
However I did expose variables that allowed the game designers to change 
hoop heights and pole distances as they see fit, including the length of levels.

**Highlighted skills:**

* **Understanding of game-feel:** I've paid close attention to the timing and speed of all animations/movements to create the best game-feel possible
* **Shaders:** Custom shaders on the ball, hoops and targets for improved visuals and game-feel
* **Game Logic:** Fully functional, looping game logic.

This project was developed during my time at Hero Games.
Due to being a prototype, there might be some bugs or unfixed issues in the video.
