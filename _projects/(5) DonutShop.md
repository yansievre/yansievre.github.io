# Donut Shop 3D

I implemented nearly the entire prototype except the customer 3D models. 
The dough and the cooking of the donuts were made by me entirely. 
See the showcase video below.

**Highlighted skills:**

- **Mesh Deformation:** Spreading the dough, cutting out the donut pieces, enlarging the donuts while they're cooking.
- **Shaders:** Cooked donut shader, with variables that allowed changing between uncooked & cooked states. 
The dipping effect which cuts off the rendering based on how much the donut was dipped.
- **Mathematics:** Mesh deformation/cutting calculations. Overlap detection for the cutting action, where the overlap are is highlighted.
- **Game Logic:** Fully functional, looping game logic.

This project was developed during my time at Hero Games.
Due to being a prototype, there might be some bugs or unfixed issues in the video.
