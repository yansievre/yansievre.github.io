# Hoop Jump

The goal for this project was to prototype a hyper-casual game where we control a ball that traverses the path automatically
but we can jump the ball at anytime using an aimer. The game was made entirely by me, including all models and animations.

The level design tool for this game was a modular system where prefabs could be welded together to form a level and any prefab could be selected to form a sequential list.

**Highlighted skills:**

* **Understanding of game-feel:** I've paid close attention to the timing and speed of all animations/movements to create the best game-feel possible
* **Shaders:** Custom shaders on the ball, hoops and targets for improved visuals and game-feel
* **Game Logic:** Fully functional, looping game logic.

This project was developed during my time at Hero Games.
Due to being a prototype, there might be some bugs or unfixed issues in the video.
