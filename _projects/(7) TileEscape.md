# Tile Escape!

I developed the entire game except the 3D models and the selection of colors. See the gameplay video below:

{% include elements/video.html id="8jQA9W7ERx4" %}

My work for this game consist of:
- A grid system
- An action system that resembles a turn based system, where the enemy side is AI
- A visual level editor that allows the game designers to design levels easily, exports level data as text files for them to be loaded in runtime.
See the showcase video below.


**Highlighted skills:**

* **Systematic Approach to Development:** I implemented different systems that tackle the different parts of the game logic.
  * A grid system
  * An action system that resembles a turn based system, where the enemy side is AI
* **Editor Tool Development:** A visual level editor that allows the game designers to design levels easily, exports level data as text files for them to be loaded in runtime.
* **Game Logic:** Fully functional, looping game logic.

See the level editor in action below:

This project was developed during my time at Hero Games.
Due to being a prototype, there might be some bugs or unfixed issues in the video.
