# Action Combat Demo

After working mostly on mobile games, I wanted to challenge myself and explore what makes action combat feel "just right.".
The demo below is inspired by Hades II from Supergiant Games.

This demo was created from scratch; modeling the character, to animating it, 
to adjusting every little value in Unity to find the sweet spot. 
To get it right, I analyzed Hades II gameplay frame by frame. Inspecting exactly how it works, 
and I've constructed my own set of configurations to achieve a similar result. Some examples are:
- Character rotation allowance during attacks, at any given point
- Timing and queuing of input for new actions
- Movement during attacks, whether based on initial direction or current input.
- Animation curves to adjust attack timings directly in Unity

Even with all of these settings, achieving a satisfying balance seemed rather difficult. 

This experience has taught me that great gameplay, especially character controllers, comes from intricately integrating various disciplines and iterating constantly until everything clicks.
