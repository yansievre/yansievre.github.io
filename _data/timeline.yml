  description: Studying pure mathematics was more than just acquiring practical skills; it was a journey of cultivating patience, problem-solving, and creative thinking. Delving into abstract concepts and proofs honed my ability to think outside the box and approach challenges with a fresh perspective. While the direct application of mathematical theorems may not be evident in my day-to-day work as a game developer, the discipline instilled in me a fearlessness when confronting problems and a tenacity to explore unconventional solutions. My time spent studying pure mathematics was invaluable in shaping my approach to problem-solving and fostering a mindset of continuous learning and innovation.
